Powereg
=======
A simple power management tool that controls the cpus power profile, EPP, as well as battery thresholds for ThinkPads.
Currently only supports AMD cpus. If you have an Intel cpu and would like to expand this project, feel free submit a pr!

** Still in development **

Todo
----
- [ ] make aur package
- [ ] tests somehow?
- [ ] auto start/stop bluetooth ('bluetoothctl power off/on')
- [ ] split into multiple source files
- [X] auto enable amd_pstate on cpu_states setup
- [X] split amd and intel
- [X] config file for battery thresholds
- [X] print messages with color (green, yellow, red)
- [X] allocator.free(var) on everything I fucking forgot wow.
- [X] get number of cpu cores at compile time?
    - try and remove use of allocator?
    - zig build auto-detects, zig build -Dcpu-count=8 manual
