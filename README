Powereg
=======
A simple power management tool that controls the cpus power profile, EPP, as well as battery thresholds for ThinkPads.
Currently only supports AMD cpus. If you have an Intel cpu and would like to expand this project, feel free submit a pr!

Getting started
---------------
For AMD cpus, make sure that '/sys/devices/system/cpu/amd_pstate/status' is set to active

./install.sh
sudo powereg --install

You can configure powereg via '~/.config/powereg/config.toml'.

Options
--------
Powereg will need to be run with sudo
- '--monitor': simply display your system states while powereg runs as a daemon in the background.
- '--live': runs powereg in the background while showing your system states.
- '--daemon': runs powereg with no feedback.
- '--install': install powereg via 'systemctl enable' and 'systemctl start'.
- '--uninstall': uninstalls powereg via 'systemctl disable' and 'systemctl stop'.

Todo
----
- [ ] print messages toggle with debug flag (develop a nice macro for this)
- [ ] auto enable amd_pstate on cpu_states setup
- [X] (should be fixed now) on sleep/sleep+plugging charger in, it does into a performance mode even tho its not plugged in
- [ ] make aur package
