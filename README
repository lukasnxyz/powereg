Powereg
=======
A simple power management tool that controls the cpus power profile, EPP, as well as battery thresholds for ThinkPads.
Currently only supports AMD cpus. If you have an Intel cpu and would like to expand this project, feel free submit a pr!

** Still in development **

Todo
----
- [ ] make aur package
- [ ] tests somehow?
- [ ] auto start/stop bluetooth ('bluetoothctl power off/on')
- [ ] nicer --live/--monitor cli view/updating
- [ ] remove need for allocator (only in Config now)
- [ ] make high/low cpu load configurable in config
- [ ] a cache struct to store recently read data from SystemState, but that is immutable
    so it can be printed via a writer for example and cache is nice and can be used for
    visualization later as well
- [ ] use libsystemd over calling system shell commands for systemctl
- [X] rename PersFd.deinit() to PersFd.close()
- [X] better way than just 512 buffer read in persfd

Getting started
---------------
./install.sh
sudo powereg --install
