Powereg
=======
A simple power management tool that controls the cpus power profile, EPP, as well as battery thresholds for ThinkPads.

Getting started
---------------
For AMD cpus, make sure that '/sys/devices/system/cpu/amd_pstate/status' is set to active
./install.sh
sudo powereg --install

- '--monitor': simply display your system states while powereg runs as a daemon in the background.
- '--live': runs powereg in the background while showing your system states.
- '--daemon': runs powereg with no feedback.
- '--install': install powereg via 'systemctl enable' and 'systemctl start'.
- '--uninstall': uninstalls powereg via 'systemctl disable' and 'systemctl stop'.
