Powereg
=======
A simple power management tool that controls the cpus power profile, EPP, as well as battery thresholds for ThinkPads.
Currently only supports AMD cpus. If you have an Intel cpu and would like to expand this project, feel free submit a pr!

** Still in development **

Todo
----
- [ ] make aur package
- [ ] tests somehow?
- [ ] auto start/stop bluetooth ('bluetoothctl power off/on')
- [ ] nicer --live/--monitor cli view/updating
- [ ] remove need for allocator (only in Config now)
- [ ] rename PersFd.deinit() to PersFd.close()
- [ ] make high/low cpu load configurable in config
- [ ] better way than just 512 buffer read in persfd
